
Loading Dataset :

```{r}
library(datasets)
library('ggplot2')
data(trees)
summary(trees)

```

5-number summary of all features :

```{r}
print("5-number summary of Girth")

```

```{r}
fivenum(trees$Girth)
```

```{r}
print("5-number summary of Height")

```

```{r}
fivenum(trees$Height)
```

```{r}
print("5-number summary of Volume")

```

```{r}
fivenum(trees$Volume)
```

Histrogram for each feature :

```{r}
ggplot(trees, aes(x=Girth)) + geom_histogram(color="yellow", fill="darkred", binwidth = 1)
```
```{r}
ggplot(trees, aes(x=Height)) + 
  geom_histogram(color="darkblue", fill="darkgreen", binwidth = 1)
```
```{r}
ggplot(trees, aes(x=Volume)) + 
  geom_histogram(color="black", fill="yellow", binwidth = 5)
```


Answer : Height has a normal distribution. Girth and Volume exhibit positive skewness.

skewness of each feature :

```{r}
library("moments")

sprintf("Skewness of Girth: %.3f", skewness(trees$Girth))
sprintf("Skewness of Height: %.3f", skewness(trees$Height))
sprintf("Skewness of Volume: %.3f", skewness(trees$Volume))
```


Answer : The values match with those of the plots (Histograms)





```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:



Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
