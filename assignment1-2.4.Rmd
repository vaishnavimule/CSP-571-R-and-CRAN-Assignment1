
Loading dataset-Boston :

```{r}
library(MASS)
library('ggplot2')
data(Boston)
attach(Boston)
summary(Boston)
```

Fitting regression between medv and istat :
```{r}
lm.fit=lm(medv~lstat)
summary(lm.fit)
```

Plot the fitted values vs residual :

```{r}
plot(lstat ,medv)
abline (lm.fit)

abline (lm.fit ,lwd = 2, col = 'darkgreen')
```


```{r}
plot(predict (lm.fit), residuals (lm.fit), xlab="Fitted Values", ylab="Residuals")
```


Answer: Looking at the plot above, the relationship between medv and lstat does depict some non-linearity.

Predicting reponse values for lstst = 5, 10, and 15. And finding confidence and prediction intervals.

```{r}
predict(lm.fit ,data.frame(lstat=c(5,10,15) ),interval="confidence")
```

```{r}
predict(lm.fit ,data.frame(lstat=c(5,10,15) ),interval="prediction")
```


Answer: Confidence and Prediction interval essentially predicts the response so they do the same thing but the interpretation is different. The prediction interval will be wider than the confidence interval since it must account for the variability in the mean and standard deviation estimators.


Including lstat^2


```{r}
flexible_lm.fit=lm(medv~lstat+I(lstat^2),data=Boston)
summary(flexible_lm.fit)
```

Answer : Linear Model adjusted r^2 = 0.5432 
         non-linear Model adjusted r^2 = 0.6393


Plotting relation between predictor and response :

```{r}
ggplot(Boston, aes(x = lstat, y = medv)) + geom_point(shape=1) +
stat_smooth(method = 'lm', formula = y~x+poly(x,2))
```







```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```
